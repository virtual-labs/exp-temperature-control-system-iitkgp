### About the Experiment 
**System description**

Temperature control is one of the most common industrial control systems that are in operation. 
The plant to be controlled is a specially designed oven having a short heating and cooling time. A solid state temperature sensor converts the absolute temperature information
to a proportional electrical signal. The reference and actual temperatures are indicated in degree celsius on a switch selectable digital display.

The controller unit compares the reference and the measured signals to generate the error.
