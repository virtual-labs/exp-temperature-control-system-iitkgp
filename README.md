### About the Experiment 
**System description**
<br>
					Temperature control is one of the most common industrial control systems that are in operation. This equipment is designed to expose the students to the 
					intricacies of such a system in the 'friendly' environment of a laboratory,free from disturbances and uncertainties of plant prevalent in an actual process.
					The plant to be controlled is a specialy designed oven having a short heating and cooling time.A solid state temperature sensor converts the absolute temperature information
					to a proportional electrical signal. The reference and actual temperatures are indicated in degree Celsius on a switch selectable digital display.
					<br>
					The controller unit compares the reference and the measured signals to generate the error.
